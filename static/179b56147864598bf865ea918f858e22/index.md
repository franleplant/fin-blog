For my entire life I have always wanted to change the world, from my early days
when I fantasized about getting my parents back together to my teen years when
I wondered about helping the poor to my present years when I dream about fixing
what seems to be broken while building on top what seems to be right (as my friend
would say: for some definition of right).

I have stood in awe looking at how companies such as [Tesla][19], [Space-X][21], [Impossible Foods][20],
[Pfizer][22] (and so many scientists), [Amazon][23], [Apple][24], [Google][25], [Samsung][26], [the Linux Foundation][27], et al
have changed the world, they have built products that have profoundly impacted or will impact
our lives, think about phones, think about the internet as we know it, think about having
the biggest knowledge library in the known history of human kind literally
at your fingertips and virtually for free. Or maybe think about what Tesla and Space-X are
aiming to build, a new bread of transportation and new home for human kind.

I guess you could take these achievements apart if you focus on the bad parts of our society
which I don't deny they exist, but I don't think we can deny the net benefits and how
humanity will look back 20 or 50 years back at these pioneers will be highly positive.

## My current stage in life

And so I am at a breaking point in my life, I feel just ripe, just able to do something big,
I want to try to change the world for the better.

I have been an unofficial Tech Lead at my current company for at least two years now, and
while I have seized the experience to grow technically, personally and leadership-wise there's
a lot of overworking and overthinking involved, weekends, nights dedicated to someone else's business,
and my reasoning is, I do want to do something big and I am already putting the long hours, the responsibility,
the leadership, the stress, and so there's little to argue against the possibility of aiming higher.

I have been reading about the Startup culture that involves innovation and passion and creativity,
I have been reading about how the process is and there's a lot of way already paved for anybody who
wants to do something great.

I might be on the older side of the entrepreneurs but hey, I have been brought up in poor (and
getting poorer) Latin American country, my grandparents moved up the ladder from poor (and I mean
poor like having 10 siblings and leaving in precarious conditions), their biggest aspirations where
to have a steady job at a big company and a house with regular meals, the culture around me is not
of dreamers, is about survivors (among other things),
and so there's little to no entrepreneur culture and that might
explain me being late, nevertheless I will play my odds.

## Startups and incubators

I have some ideas and people to do them with floating around that I wont disclose
at the moment for obvious reasons and I'm using extensively the documentation
that [ycombinator][16] (an incubator) has online, for example the [faq][10], or the
[how to apply][18] guide.

They have a nice [program][14] where, if you are selected, you will be able to
get help from the experts to give form to your project and if everything goes
correctly get funding, while also getting a lot of networking thanks to the extensive
network of founders they possess. This [article][17] describes exactly what happens
inside the program.

It surprises me how many [misconceptions][11] I actually had about the whole process,
and so I'm pretty thankful about them writing the more common ones down.

There is so much to innovate over and they actually have a broad [list of areas that they
see with a good future][13] although you need not to restrict to that list.
And simply by looking at that list my head and my heart start trembling with emotion, of
eagerness to tackle those problems. At this point I am non stop thinking machine.

I will be doing the [Startup school][15] free program they provide and I would
probably recommend my potential co-founders to also take it.

I am also reading [Zero to One by Peter Thiel][28] which so far has been a really good book.

## Closing

It is scary as hell to be in front of this massive uncertainty wall, I still
ask my self if _"am I **x** enough"_, where **x** might be _smart_, _willing_, _capable_,
_strong_, _hard-worker_, and so much more.

Luckily I have strong friends that are definitively co-founder material and a partner
that got my back.

If you are interested if having updates about my journey let me know.
