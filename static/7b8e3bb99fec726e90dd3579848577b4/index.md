## Introduction

Let's build the basic boilerplate for an OpenId Connect based Authentication mechanism
for our Node.js / Typescript app that supports SSO (Single Sign On experience) out of the box
and that will fit very well with a microservice architecture with no statefulness added.

This sort of setup is great for microservice architectures because

- it provides clear authentication (and authorization) interfaces based on industries best practices
- it works well with self contained auth tokens that can be used for communications across microservices
- it requires no extra stateful layers (such as session databases)
- it can be easily expanded to make up a Single Sign on experience across multiple apps and even across companies.

## So what is OpenId Connect?

> OpenId Connect (a.k.a oidc) is an _interoperable authentication protocol_ based on the OAuth 2.0 family of specifications.
>
> [src][14]

The line between OpenId and OAuth is blurry in practice and in learning material in the web the concepts
are sometimes a mix and match of both.

I like to think of OpenId and OAuth as a set of specifications that
define standard APIs for Authentication and Authorization, respectively.

> OpenID Connect lets developers authenticate their users across websites and
> apps without having to own and manage password files. For the app builder,
> it provides a secure verifiable, answer to the question:
> “What is the identity of the person currently using the browser or native app that is connected to me?”

This has enabled 3rd party Authentication providers and the always present "Log In with X"
you see around the web, such Auth providers include Google (the one we use in the example code),
Auth0, Microsoft, Okta, among many others. [See certified providers here][15]

Additionally, OpenId Connect can be used in enterprise settings like shared Auth and Identity provider
across many apps (think about Microsoft active directory, or Okta's service)
providing a Single Sign On experience; and also as a way of structuring a microservice
architecture with multiple "clients" (OAuth lingo for applications that interact with the Auth Server).

If you want to go down the rabbit hole and learn more check these resources out

- [Nate Barbettini's OAuth and OpenId in plain English][13]
- [Okta's Ilustrated Guide to Oauth and OpenId Connect][10]
- [IEEE OAuth 2.0 RFC][12] (it is dense but has all the details)

Here is a nice illustration of one of the most common ways of Authenticating with
OAuth 2.0 and OpenId Connect: the authorization code flow

## That's fine, but why should I care?

OAuth 2.0 and oidc have become ever present in the modern application development landscape and
although the tooling is really good and hides a lot of details chances are that you will still require
a decent high level understanding of what you are doing.

This applies both to already existing applications and to the practice of designing and creating new
applications with modern architectures such as microservice oriented one.

I will try to find the sweet spot between comprehensive and high level coverage, let's hope
I can achieve it.

## Show me the code!

Let's build a simple application that uses OAuth 2.0 and oidc. The idea is to show

- how to use 3rd party Auth and Identity providers
- how to integrate those mechanisms with something familiar to the web platform: session cookies!
- how to easily manage sessions in the Request-Response web app cycle (no libs here!)
- how the session can be structured to be self contained for a stateless session management
- security implications
- how this application can be used to achieve SSO (single sign on experience across multiple apps)

You can check the full code [here][19].

### A note on tooling

I have found a nice certified NodeJs library called [openid-client][16], it is a nice library with
decent Typescript support that makes it very easy to integrate Identity providers.

Another really cool thing about OpenId Connect is the concept of [Discovery][17] which
basically means that although there are a bunch of parameters involved in setting up a proper
oidc flow like multiple urls, encryption algorithms, public keys to verify tokens, etc;
you really just need to use one url and, if the client library you are using supports it, the client will
use this Discovery mechanism to look for a [Discovery Document][18] that contains all the necessary parameters
and you are good to go!. `openid-client` supports this!.

### Step 1: What are we building?

We are going to use a top-down approach, so first we are going to cover how the app
works at the business logic level and in later steps we are going to cover
the "lib" side of things where we implement the proper express middleware, session management,
cookie storage, etc.

The app is really simple, it has two content routes

- `/` or the home where we show the "login" button and it is public.
- `/private` were we display some information about the currently logged in user. If there is no user logged in we simply display an error.

Here are some pictures:

<style>
.screen-img img {
  border: 3px solid #CCC;
}
</style>

<div class="screen-img">

![Initial public screen with login link](./screen1.png)

![Authenticating with the oidc provider](./screen2.png)

![Back to our private route in our app](./screen3.png)

</div>

There are at least two additional routes that have to do with the OAuth flow
that we will cover later.

This is the `index.ts` that makes up the high level app implementation, think of this
as a mix of the boilerplate plus the two domain / business specific routes.

```typescript
const app = express();

// Necessary for express to parse the cookies into a nice
// higher level object
app.use(cookieParser());

// initialises the Issuer and the Client
app.use(auth.initialize);
// Deals with the user session
app.use(auth.session);
// Adds the OAuth / OpenId necessary routes.
app.use(auth.routes());

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  // use the pre configured view engine
  // to render the index.mustache file
  res.render("index");
});

app.get("/private", auth.requireAuth, (req, res) => {
  // This is the main high level hook for the user
  // session, we will be building this later
  const claims = req.session!.tokenSet.claims();

  // render private.mustache and interpolate
  // the following data
  res.render("private", {
    email: claims.email,
    picture: claims.picture,
    name: claims.name,
  });
});

app.listen(process.env.PORT, () => {
  console.log(
    `Express started on port ${process.env.PORT}`
  );
});
```

Next we will cover more details (descending into the details).

### Step 2: Initializing

First we need to initialize the [openid-client][16]
Issuer (the one that discovers all the publicly available OpenId configuration) and later the Client
(the one that we will use to make all the underlying HTTP calls).
We will abstract this step into a middleware and save the instances into the `req.app` object
since these things need to be instantiated once per app.

```typescript
export async function initialize(
  req: Request,
  res: Response,
  next: NextFunction
) {
  if (req.app.authIssuer) {
    return next();
  }

  const googleIssuer = await Issuer.discover(
    "https://accounts.google.com"
  );
  const client = new googleIssuer.Client({
    client_id: process.env.OAUTH_CLIENT_ID!,
    client_secret: process.env.OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET!,
    redirect_uris: [`${getDomain()}/auth/callback`],
    response_types: ["code"],
  });

  req.app.authIssuer = googleIssuer;
  req.app.authClient = client;

  next();
}
```

Note: `getDomain` is a thin helper that returns exactly this `http://${process.env.HOST}:${process.env.PORT}`.

### Step 3: Log In

We have a nice comprehensive sequence diagram of the all the HTTP redirects and
interactions that make up the complete OAuth / OpenId Connect authorization code flow
below in a [bonus section](#bonus-the-complete-sequence-diagram-of-oidc-authentication)

In this step we are going to build the two endpoints necessary for this type of auth flow:

1. Auth entry point: Create a route that redirects to the right oidc provider authentication page and that kicks starts the whole auth flow, in our case we simply called it: `/auth/login` but you can use whatever you like.
2. Callback: Create a route that the oidc provider will redirect back from the auth page with the auth code that we will later exchange for the proper access, id and refresh tokens. In our case we simply called it `/auth/callback` but again it can be whatever you want it to be.

We also encapsulated these routes into a nice middleware that we called `auth.routes`.

```typescript
// Auth entry point.
router.get("/auth/login", function (req, res, next) {
  // Check the full code to see a
  // concrete implementation of this
  const state = calcState(extraContent);

  // calculate the url where we want to redirect to
  const authUrl = req.app.authClient.authorizationUrl({
    scope: "openid email profile",
    state,
  });

  setAuthStateCookie(res, state);
  res.redirect(authUrl);
});

// Callback
router.get("/auth/callback", async (req, res, next) => {
  const client = req.app.authClient;

  // extract all the necessary query params
  // like the authorization code.
  const params = client.callbackParams(req);
  // read the state cookie
  const state = getAuthStateCookie(req);
  // exchange the authorization code for the access,
  // refresh and id token, this is what makes up the
  // main `Back channel` communication, it is considered
  // more secure and will include client_id and client_secret.
  const tokenSet = await client.callback(
    `${getDomain()}/auth/callback`,
    params,
    // The lib will compare the state that the
    // identity provider passes as params
    // with the one we stored in the cookies.
    { state }
  );
  // We can fetch the userinfo (basic identity attributes)
  const user = await client.userinfo(tokenSet);

  // Set the session cookie,
  // we could also set req.session but
  // since we are returning immediately is not
  // a must
  const sessionCookie = serialize({ tokenSet, user });
  setSessionCookie(req, sessionCookie);

  res.redirect("/");
});
```

Notes:

- check the [complete code][19] to see how to implement logout and a back-to-original-route mechanism

As you can see the _Auth entry point_ is a very simple sync redirect to the Identity provider's login,
the library is doing a lot of the work for us but the `authUrl` will contain the `client_id`,
the callback url `http://host:port/auth/callback` in our case, required `scopes`, etc.
This is also what we call the "Front channel" and it is considered not entirely secure, that is why
we are not sending the client secret at this stage, remember that this happens all in the browser via
HTTP redirects.

The _Callback_ will be redirected from a successful login with the Identity provider and
will exchange the authorization code for the tokens (check inline comments).
This is the step where we more commonly deal with persistent sessions, notice that
the Identity Provider doesn't deal with this and that's something we need to deal with ourselves.

Check the `state` parameter, this acts as a sort of [XSRF a.k.a. CSRF a.k.a. csurf][23] token that we can use to
prevent XSRF attacks but also to store _state_ across the OAuth flow. See exercise at the bottom for more info.
Check the [full code][19] for a concrete but very simple working implementation.

We are going to use a very simple self contained stateless strategy here, we will cover it in more details
in the next section but at a high level what we are doing is setting a persistent cookie (the session cookie)
that will travel in all requests from the browser to our local server and that we will use to identify
users that already identified themselves.

### Step 4: Persistent Session

There are several ways of handling sessions but in most cases
it all boils down to persisting a session across requests and
identifying requests with one or zero sessions, meaning, identifying the
already authenticated and identified users that are making requests to our app or simply
acknowledging that there is no previously authenticated user.

Sessions are most commonly persisted in the form of a long lived cookie in the browsers and
their content might be a session id that is mapped to the session object in a database
server side which is the stateful solution; or the content might be the entire self contained session object,
which is the stateless solution, this is a simpler approach that will work for us
and that has its merits in the microservice architecture.

> Why do we care about stateless vs stateful? Having a self contained cookie means that we can
> know certain facts about the authenticated users without having to either interact with a database
> or another service. Stateless is desired as much as possible because it is easy to horizontally scale
> i.e. adding more instances of the app running in other nodes in our cluster, whereas scaling stateful
> services is another whole challenge (think about master slave relationship between databases,
> replication, backup, consistency considerations, etc).
> The typical solution for a stateful session is to store a simple session id in the browser and then associate
> that id in a key value database such as [redis][20]

**When do we write the session cookie?**

We write it at two main steps:

- after login in
- after refreshing the auth tokens (not necessary in a stateful session schema)

We also clear it in two main steps:

- after logout
- after trying to refresh a token and the refresh token has expired.

**And when do we read the session cookie? And what do we do with it?**

This where the fun begins. We read the session cookie _on every request_,
and if we find one then we are going to parse it into a session object or instance
and store it in the `req` object, this fits super fine because the parsed, hydrated session
object only applies on a particular request, the next request might belong to another user or even
to a non authenticated user.

Why do we need to parse it? Basically, we will store it as string in the cookie and when
we read the cookie we are going to parse it back to an object, this is a very simple approach, more
commonly you will store the session as a base64 encoded json object to save space and later you will
parse it into an instance of a class so that you can cache some results and provide certain useful methods
to the rest of the app. In our case we simply reuse the `TokenSet` class with useful methods that
the [openid-client][16] lib provides.

This is a nice illustration of the flow you will soon see in code:

<style>
.flow2 img {
 max-width: 500px;
}

.flow2 p {
text-align: center;

}
</style>

<div class="flow2">

![Session Middleware flow diagram](./flow2.svg)

</div>

Enough talk, let's code:

```typescript
export async function session(
  req: Request,
  res: Response,
  next: NextFunction
) {
  const sessionCookie = getSessionCookie(req);
  // If there is no session cookie it means there is no
  // authenticated user associated with this request,
  // no further work needed.
  if (!sessionCookie) {
    return next();
  }

  const client = req.app.authClient;
  // Parse the cookie into a TokenSet instance
  const session = deserialize(sessionCookie);

  // Refresh the tokens if necessary
  if (session.tokenSet.expired()) {
    try {
      const refreshedTokenSet = await client.refresh(
        session.tokenSet
      );
      session.tokenSet = refreshedTokenSet;
      // set the cookie with the refreshed tokens
      setSessionCookie(req, serialize(session));
    } catch (err) {
      // this can throw when the refresh
      // token has expired,
      // logout completely when that happens
      clearSessionCookie(req);
      return next();
    }
  }

  // We also verify that the tokens inside the cookie are valid
  // with public keys mechanisms covered by the JWT spec.
  // This is unfortunately a private method of the lib, but basically
  // it grabs the id_token and decodes it as JWT with a public key
  // that we got as part as the discovery process, if this succeeds it means
  // that the token inside the cookie is a token that has been crated by our
  // identity provided and thus it is secure and fine and we can trust it.
  const validate = client.validateIdToken as any;
  try {
    await validate.call(client, session.tokenSet);
  } catch (err) {
    console.log("bad token signature found in auth cookie");
    return next(new Error("Bad Token in Auth Cookie!"));
  }

  // After all that work the only thing remaining is
  // to store the valid session object into req.session
  // for the rest of the app to use.
  req.session = session;

  next();
}
```

What might the rest of the app do with `req.session`?
Just to give some ideas:

- check if there is a user logged in (i.e. only allowing to view certain content to authenticated users)
- display information about the logged in user, such as menu icons etc
- fetch data associated with a user to a database or another service
- check user permissions and create a more complex allow list of routes
- many many more things.

The main point of this middleware (which is inspired by prior work such as
[express-session][21] and [Passport.js][22]) is to abstract all the logic of
parsing the session cookie, refreshing if necessary and hydrating the `req.session` object
in a single place, the rest of the app can rely on that being there and that nothing else will
need to be done there.

We also have a nice example middleware that prevents non authenticated users to access
certain routes:

```typescript
export async function requireAuth(
  req: Request,
  res: Response,
  next: NextFunction
) {
  const session = req.session;
  if (!session) {
    return next(new Error("unauthenticated"));
  }

  next();
}
```

Of course this will only work if the `session` middleware runs first in the middleware chain
and this runs later, that is why it is important that your session middleware to be run as early as possible,
at least before your routes definitions.

### Step 5: Log Out

In here you have two options:

- Logging out of just your app
- Logging out entirely out of the identity provider

We are going to use the first approach:

```typescript
router.get("/auth/logout", async (req, res, next) => {
  const client = req.app.authClient;
  const tokenSet = req.session?.tokenSet;

  // Make sure the access token we got from the identity provider
  // gets revoked, this is for security reasons
  await client.revoke(tokenSet!.access_token!);

  // Clean up session cookies
  clearSessionCookie(res);

  res.redirect("/");
});
```

### Step 6: Putting it all together

With a little bit of express experience we can encapsulate all the previous logic
into nice middlewares and leave the rest of the app to deal with domain / business logic.

We put all the authentication related code in the `auth` directory, and the high level api is
made up of middlewares. You can use middleware factories for more complex use cases (functions that accept
options and return middlewares, and yes, the router _is_ a middleware).

### Step 7: Single Sign On

Single Sign On (SSO) means that if you are already authenticated with one app using the same
OpenId Identity Provider then you will be almost automatically authenticated we other apps.

We have set a nice example in the repo, check instructions to see it in action [here][19].

How does it work?

- the Session cookie is completely independent in each app (see the domain note on the repo's README).
- If you already logged in with app1 then when you try to login with app2 then you won't need to introduce your credentials and the OAuth flow will happen without you (the user) needing to do anything, that is why I say it is almost automatic.

## Bonus: the complete sequence diagram of oidc authentication

Most of the time you will see this sequence diagram simplified, but I wanted
to show you in full details all the steps and http redirects there are inside this
transaction, most of the time you won't need to worry about these but I think
it is a nice exercise to have it detailed fully like this:

![OAuth OpenId authorization code flow sequence diagram](./flow3.svg)

## Bonus: what are the access, refresh and id tokens?

Each identity provider might use them differently but these are
some of the core ideas behind each of them

- _access token_: an opaque value with a short expiration that the identity server uses to identify a user (think of it as a portable session id)
- _refresh token_: another opaque value with a longer expiration that it is used to refresh the access token and the id token. Long lived sessions are typically handled by this two step process to give more control to identity providers.
- _id token_: this is what OpendId Connect adds, this is a self contained jwt that contains claims (attributes) about the identity of the currently logged in user. This is what makes sense the most to use inside your own system to check the identity of the user. You can cryptographically verify its validity and it will contain minimal information such as the `sub` id (the subject id or the user id), the email, the names, etc.

## Exercise 1

How would you implement a "back to" functionality?

Let's say that you originally tried to access `/private/route/1` but you weren't authenticated yet
so we redirected you to `/auth/login`.
After going through all the auth flow we would like for the app to redirect automatically back
to `/private/route/1`.

<details>
  <summary>Show me the answer</summary>

See answer [here][24]. A couple of notes:

- you basically store a `backTo` param in the state and in the cookie
- you can store more stuff in the `state`
- we need it also in the cookie to prevent XSRF.
- Check the [IETF standard][25] and read more [here][26]
