            We are two Software Developers with degrees in Engineering that love
            to talk about programming, tech culture and other random stuff.
          </p>

          <p>
            We have been working in the industry for more than 7 years, and have
            experience with a range of programming languages, programming
            techniques and philosophies. We are passionate about reflecting on
            these and more subjects and hopefully, in the process, we can help
            others improve and move their careers forward.
