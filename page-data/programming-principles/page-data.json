In this context these principles, such as <strong>Clarity</strong>, will\nhave its own concrete meanings. It also is important to reflect on what it means\nto be clear for a given context and propose potential improvements if possible, which will\nbe also highly subjective. The important conclusion is, yes, these things are subjective, but\nwe do not develop software in a vacuum and so <strong>they will have more concrete meanings in the\ncontext where we develop software.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"clarity\" style=\"position:relative;\">Clarity<a href=\"#clarity\" aria-label=\"clarity permalink\" class=\"header-anchor after\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Programming can be thought of as a way of expressing ideas in a formal language,\nin that sense we could even go as far as thinking <strong>programming as a weird form of art\nor even poetry</strong>, there are always those pieces of code that touch our hearts, and\nso long as we have the main goal of software in mind: solving problems, I believe\nis fine to take this idea of beauty in.</p>\n<p>Code is created with two main purposes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>to tell machines what do,</li>\n<li>to communicate ideas with other people.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If we don’t express our <strong>ideas correctly</strong> the machine will yield at us, and\nif we don’t express the <strong>right ideas</strong> then other forms of validations should yield at us i.e. unit tests.</p>\n<p>The second part is the one where <strong>Clarity</strong> becomes important.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Code should be easy to understand by our team mates.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Code should be as easy to understand as possible for our team mates\nand humans in general, that’s in fact the <strong>main purpose of programming languages</strong>,\nto go closer to humans and abstract away the machine language.</p>\n<p>How to improve <strong>Clarity</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>identify and use the main <strong>concepts</strong> in your domain i.e. <code class=\"language-text\">nodes</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">users</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">cars</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">contracts</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">unverifiedUser</code>.</li>\n<li>naming is important, take your time finding the right names.</li>\n<li>are you sure about that one liner? Maybe break it into multiple lines?</li>\n<li>read your code entirely after “finishing it” i.e. <strong>review your own PRs</strong>.</li>\n<li>identify hard to understand sections</li>\n<li>ask: how can I make them better?</li>\n<li>if you can then do that</li>\n<li>if you cannot then comment the complexity away</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sometimes some piece of code might be reflecting something inherently\ndifficult to understand, so there’s no easy way out of that and so\nyou should add comments to those sections.</p>\n<p><strong>Concepts are a fundamental idea in programming</strong>, we never deal with\nsome variable or some function, we deal with <strong>semantic concepts</strong> and\noperations that have strong meanings in the <strong>domain</strong> we are working.\nA good program will use strong concepts and thus will have good\nnaming across the board. <strong>Make sure you get the concepts right</strong>.</p>\n<p>Modern software development might involve millions of lines of code, across\nmultiple programming languages, covering complex business rules, we really\ndon’t want to make this already complicated artifact anymore and so\n<strong>Clarity becomes a tool for managing complexity</strong>.</p>\n<p>An example, I see a lot of newbie programmers abuse the indexing operation in a tight chain.</p>\n<p>Let’s say we have a contrived data structure as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"typescript\"><pre class=\"language-typescript\"><code class=\"language-typescript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">interface</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">IUsersColors</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>userId<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token builtin\">number</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token builtin\">Array</span><span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>hex<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token builtin\">string</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> name<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token builtin\">string</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token operator\">></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>In my experience, new programmers tend to do:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"typescript\"><pre class=\"language-typescript\"><code class=\"language-typescript\"><span class=\"token comment\">// access the \"i\" favourite color hex</span>\n<span class=\"token function\">setColor</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>usersColors<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>userId<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>i<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>But i found the following more clear albeit longer.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"typescript\"><pre class=\"language-typescript\"><code class=\"language-typescript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> selectedUserColors <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> usersColors<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>userId<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> color <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> selectedUserColors<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>i<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> colorHex <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> color<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token function\">setColor</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>colorHex<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>This is my <strong>subjective</strong> judging of the code, perhaps\nin your context and for you and your team mates the\nfirst case is clearer. Not one example\nis wrong, but the point is that given our context,\nwe should go for the clearest solution.</p>\n<h2 id=\"simplicity\" style=\"position:relative;\">Simplicity<a href=\"#simplicity\" aria-label=\"simplicity permalink\" class=\"header-anchor after\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Note how we say Clarity <strong>then</strong> Simplicity.\nThis means that <strong>Clarity</strong> is our first goal and our second\ngoal is <strong>Simplicity</strong> but by maximising <strong>Simplicity</strong> we should\nnever hurt <strong>Clarity</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicity</strong> is related to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle\">KISS</a> principle (Keep it simple stupid).\nWe should avoid adding more complexity to our code without good reasons.\nAlways <strong>start with the simplest solution that solves the problem</strong> and then add complexity\nonly and when needed.</p>\n<p>Feel free to use your subjective judgement to look in the future and find a balance\nbetween the current iteration’s simplicity and what you will probably need in the future.</p>\n<p>We must account for subjectivity,\ncontext and experience but always keeping in mind the question:\n<strong>Can I make this solution simpler?</strong>.</p>\n<p>It is not going to hurt you, in fact,\nif the answer is “no, because of reasons a, b and c” then you will feel more\ncomfortable and assertive about the code you are making.</p>\n<p>To achieve <strong>Simplicity</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Always start from a base case of the <strong>simplest solution</strong>, you might want to implement it or not.</li>\n<li>write code with <strong>Simplicity</strong> in mind, always choose the <strong>simplest solution</strong> and complicate when needed.</li>\n<li>combine the <strong>Simplicity</strong> mind set with your experience and find balance between the two.</li>\n<li>review the results: is this the simplest implementation?</li>\n<li>add fixes if necessary, document if the complexity cannot be controlled.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"consistency\" style=\"position:relative;\">Consistency<a href=\"#consistency\" aria-label=\"consistency permalink\" class=\"header-anchor after\">#</a></h2>\n<p>And finally we have <strong>Consistency</strong>.</p>\n<p>We should never for the sake of <strong>Consistency</strong> sacrifice Clarity or Simplicity.\nI have seen a lot of PRs where the reason for doing things in this\nunclear or complicated way was simply because other parts of the codebase were\ndoing it like so. I completely disagree with this reasoning.</p>\n<p>Code and tools and our understanding of them evolve constantly, that thing\nyou are trying to be consistent against might using some older idioms or tools\nthat have been superseded by others and that can be expressed clearer and simpler.</p>\n<p>It is also unreasonable, even more with larger codebases, to expect an entire codebase\nto move to these new idioms and tools at once, because that’s not how software evolves,\nwe write software piece by piece, little by little, so differences between newer and older\nparts are fine, track the old parts, add <code class=\"language-text\">TODO</code> and do them eventually.</p>\n<p><strong>Consistency</strong> is desired because <strong>humans are good with familiar patterns</strong> so\nthis contributes in how easy to navigate and understand your codebase is, for newcomers\nand old timers alike.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\" style=\"position:relative;\">Conclusion<a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-label=\"conclusion permalink\" class=\"header-anchor after\">#</a></h2>\n<p>There are no magical recipes for achieving these goals\nand the result of maximising these qualities might look\ndifferent depending on the team, tech culture, language, etc;\nnevertheless we should strive to achieve some sort of success\nmaximising them. Why?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Because clear, simple and consistent code is easy to understand</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And if your codebase is easier to understand then:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>we can spot errors and bugs more easy and fix them</strong></li>\n<li><strong>we can change or add new features with more ease</strong></li>\n<li>more generally, <strong>we can maintain our codebase more easily</strong></li>\n<li><strong>faster and easier developer on-boarding</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>And this all translates into <strong>faster product delivery times</strong> for your company\nplus in the way we probably would’ve\ncreate some pretty amazing and beautiful pieces of code. Everybody wins.</p>\n<p>What are your principles regarding programming? What compass do\nyou use in your everyday decision making? Let me know!.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Like the content?
