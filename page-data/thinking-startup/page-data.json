Or maybe think about what Tesla and Space-X are\naiming to build, a new bread of transportation and new home for human kind.</p>\n<p>I guess you could take these achievements apart if you focus on the bad parts of our society\nwhich I don’t deny they exist, but I don’t think we can deny the net benefits and how\nhumanity will look back 20 or 50 years back at these pioneers will be highly positive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"my-current-stage-in-life\" style=\"position:relative;\">My current stage in life<a href=\"#my-current-stage-in-life\" aria-label=\"my current stage in life permalink\" class=\"header-anchor after\">#</a></h2>\n<p>And so I am at a breaking point in my life, I feel just ripe, just able to do something big,\nI want to try to change the world for the better.</p>\n<p>I have been an unofficial Tech Lead at my current company for at least two years now, and\nwhile I have seized the experience to grow technically, personally and leadership-wise there’s\na lot of overworking and overthinking involved, weekends, nights dedicated to someone else’s business,\nand my reasoning is, I do want to do something big and I am already putting the long hours, the responsibility,\nthe leadership, the stress, and so there’s little to argue against the possibility of aiming higher.</p>\n<p>I have been reading about the Startup culture that involves innovation and passion and creativity,\nI have been reading about how the process is and there’s a lot of way already paved for anybody who\nwants to do something great.</p>\n<p>I might be on the older side of the entrepreneurs but hey, I have been brought up in poor (and\ngetting poorer) Latin American country, my grandparents moved up the ladder from poor (and I mean\npoor like having 10 siblings and leaving in precarious conditions), their biggest aspirations where\nto have a steady job at a big company and a house with regular meals, the culture around me is not\nof dreamers, is about survivors (among other things),\nand so there’s little to no entrepreneur culture and that might\nexplain me being late, nevertheless I will play my odds.</p>\n<h2 id=\"startups-and-incubators\" style=\"position:relative;\">Startups and incubators<a href=\"#startups-and-incubators\" aria-label=\"startups and incubators permalink\" class=\"header-anchor after\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I have some ideas and people to do them with floating around that I wont disclose\nat the moment for obvious reasons and I’m using extensively the documentation\nthat <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/about/\">ycombinator</a> (an incubator) has online, for example the <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/faq/\">faq</a>, or the\n<a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/howtoapply/\">how to apply</a> guide.</p>\n<p>They have a nice <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/apply\">program</a> where, if you are selected, you will be able to\nget help from the experts to give form to your project and if everything goes\ncorrectly get funding, while also getting a lot of networking thanks to the extensive\nnetwork of founders they possess. This <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/atyc/\">article</a> describes exactly what happens\ninside the program.</p>\n<p>It surprises me how many <a href=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/common-misconceptions-about-applying-to-yc/\">misconceptions</a> I actually had about the whole process,\nand so I’m pretty thankful about them writing the more common ones down.</p>\n<p>There is so much to innovate over and they actually have a broad <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/rfs/\">list of areas that they\nsee with a good future</a> although you need not to restrict to that list.\nAnd simply by looking at that list my head and my heart start trembling with emotion, of\neagerness to tackle those problems. At this point I am non stop thinking machine.</p>\n<p>I will be doing the <a href=\"https://www.startupschool.org\">Startup school</a> free program they provide and I would\nprobably recommend my potential co-founders to also take it.</p>\n<p>I am also reading <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3pzBkPv\">Zero to One by Peter Thiel</a> which so far has been a really good book.</p>\n<h2 id=\"closing\" style=\"position:relative;\">Closing<a href=\"#closing\" aria-label=\"closing permalink\" class=\"header-anchor after\">#</a></h2>\n<p>It is scary as hell to be in front of this massive uncertainty wall, I still\nask my self if <em>“am I <strong>x</strong> enough”</em>, where <strong>x</strong> might be <em>smart</em>, <em>willing</em>, <em>capable</em>,\n<em>strong</em>, <em>hard-worker</em>, and so much more.</p>\n<p>Luckily I have strong friends that are definitively co-founder material and a partner\nthat got my back.</p>\n<p>If you are interested if having updates about my journey let me know.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/thinking-startup/","readingTime":{"text":"5 min read"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Thinking about startups","date":"January 18, 2021","description":"For my entire life I've always wanted to change the world, perhaps the time is ripe for me to do just that.","tags":["y combinator","incubators","startup","entrepreneur","life"],"seoFooter":null,"author":{"id":"franleplant","bio":"Tech Lead and Software developer with a degree in Engineering.
