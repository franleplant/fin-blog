Those fees go to the <strong>Carolus Treasury</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other models of storage are possible but the purest, more secure but most expensive is fully on-chain.\nTo avoid paying obscene fees I chose a <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/layer-2-rollups/\">Layer2 scaling solution</a>: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Carolus\">Polygon</a>, which is one of the most important\nL2 currently and has a great future.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-if-the-news-are-objectively-harmful\" style=\"position:relative;\">What if the news are <em>objectively</em> harmful?<a href=\"#what-if-the-news-are-objectively-harmful\" aria-label=\"what if the news are objectively harmful permalink\" class=\"header-anchor after\">#</a></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I won’t dwell too much what this actually means in this post, let me know if you are interested in exploring this topic further.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Carolus lets the users vote up or down a given news piece.\nIf the ratio of dislikes to likes is more than 10 then the news can be censured by a moderator.</p>\n<p>The exact parameters of this functionality will be something I would expect many variants will\nexist and that a decent amount of exploration and experimentation can be made.\nI choose a really simple model that would give power to the community.</p>\n<p>In this beta version the moderator will be a wallet controlled by an individual (me) but\nin future versions I see a <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/dao/\">DAO</a> being formed that will both have moderation roles and will\ndecide what to do with the Treasury.</p>\n<p>As this is still a beta product or an experiment even I am leaving an emergency mechanism to\nremove <em>harmful</em> content. I can only promise I will use it only to remove really bad things and never to\ncensure someones opinion. Eventually this kill switch could be removed altogether.</p>\n<h3 id=\"forking\" style=\"position:relative;\">Forking<a href=\"#forking\" aria-label=\"forking permalink\" class=\"header-anchor after\">#</a></h3>\n<p>In future iterations I plan to add a <em>forking</em> functionality.\nIf the controlling moderator (individual or DAO) starts censoring more than its fair share,\nit should be really straight forward to <em>fork</em> (copy and create a new instance) the contract,\ndeploy a new front-end and avoid the censorship altogether.</p>\n<p>This would include concrete instructions, scripts and general documentation to make this mechanism as easy as possible.</p>\n<h3 id=\"carolus-treasury\" style=\"position:relative;\">Carolus Treasury<a href=\"#carolus-treasury\" aria-label=\"carolus treasury permalink\" class=\"header-anchor after\">#</a></h3>\n<p>In this early beta project the treasury will be used to finance the development of Carolus,\nif it becomes large enough I plan to release a more comprehensive strategy to use it for the common good.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-the-name-carolus\" style=\"position:relative;\">Why the name: Carolus?<a href=\"#why-the-name-carolus\" aria-label=\"why the name carolus permalink\" class=\"header-anchor after\">#</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Carolus\">Johann Carolus</a> was the publisher of the first newspaper.
