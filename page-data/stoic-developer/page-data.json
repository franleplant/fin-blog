developers, are exposed to because,\nto put it simply, we <strong>developers are professional thinkers</strong>,\nwe are weight lifters of the mind,\nbut when you push your symbolic mind hard enough it can come\nback to you in overdrive mode and attack you like a\nhammer hitting your hand instead of the nail, or even\nlike a chainsaw chopping a finger instead of a branch.</p>\n<p>Coping with these mental issues is hard but important to have\na healthy mind, life and to be an effective, efficient and holistic developer\nand I believe that the Stoic teachings are valuable tools to manage\nour emotions and behaviours and they provide a useful framework\nto tackle any situation in our life.</p>\n<p>Let this serve as a high-level introduction to Stoicism\nand a good start towards a better life.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Developers are <strong>professional thinkers</strong>,\n<strong>weight lifters of the mind</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-stoicism\" style=\"position:relative;\">What is Stoicism?<a href=\"#what-is-stoicism\" aria-label=\"what is stoicism permalink\" class=\"header-anchor after\">#</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism\">Stoicism</a>\nis a philosophical movement that aims to help people manage and\neven reduce pain in their life by recognising, at a high level, that\nlife is just a series of events and that we are the one that\nclassify them as <strong>good</strong> or <strong>bad</strong> and that the only real control we have is in\nhow we classify or interpret those events, and how willing we are\nto accept the outcomes.</p>\n<p>Stoicism trains the mind to be more resilient to pain by understanding\nthat it is unreasonable to get sad or anxious because of things\nwe don’t have control over,\nwe can only do our best, hope for the best and react as best as we can\nto whatever outcome life has in place.</p>\n<p>As you can see these are powerful teachings and have I found them very useful\nin my life, even when things turn dark.</p>\n<p>Stoicism aims to achieve <strong>strength of character</strong>, endurance and resiliency\nin the face of hardship by separating what is in our control from\nwhat’s not.</p>\n<p>Of course Stoicism doesn’t negate free will nor the things\nwe humans can achieve by affecting life around us, but instead,\nit talks about reducing suffering in the outcomes by accepting that,\nalthough we do have control over small aspects of life, we are largely\nsubject to the randomness of the universe but that we do have a strong\ncontrol over how our hearts and minds react to the outcomes.</p>\n<p>Stoicism doesn’t also go against pursue of success or riches, it just\nstates that we shouldn’t feel attached to them so that we don’t become\nprisoners of the outcomes of those pursues, because if you are successful\nand you feel attached to your success then you become a prisoner of your success\nand you will live in fear of loosing it, same goes for money, recognition or whatever.\nAnd if you couldn’t get it in the first place you will also feel bad.\nWith this, rather common, mindset, we become prisoners of randomness.\nStoicism seeks to take control, become free, and ultimately live\na more peaceful life without so much suffering.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Stoicism seeks to take control, become free, and ultimately live\na more peaceful life without so much suffering.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These teachings become even more important in the 21st century, where\nwe are in constant stress, anxiety and fear even for the smallest\nthings, like not getting the new phone, not getting enough likes,\nnot having the latest clothes,\nor of not being able to go the pub on weekends.</p>\n<p>Stoicism at last seeks deep thought about the nature of reality\nand how can we interact with it in a peaceful and relaxed way,\nby doing what we can and accepting the outcomes unconditionally.</p>\n<p>The core message of Stoicism has been incorporated in many\nmodern new age “self help” books and material like the famous\nand strongly recommended <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3eftYfD\">The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle</a>,\nand it shares some values with Buddhism and other older philosophies.</p>\n<p>By the way, many people have a strong sense that “self help” books\nand materials are <em>hippie nonsense</em> when in reality there are a lot\nof valuable takes on how to improve oneself and deal with the hard stuff\nin life, and a lot of them are modern takes of old teachings like\n<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3tCruyf\">The Bible</a>, Buddhism, et al, and that many different takes have\ngreater probability of coming through the many different personalities\nand stages in life that humans have. And of course there will be always\nnonsense out there if you really look for it.</p>\n<p>I strongly recommend <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3dyCkzO\">The Practicing Stoic by Farnsworth</a> if you\nwant a no nonsense practical introduction to Stoicism ready to be\napplied to your day to day life. The audio book is specially good.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> strictly speaking this is <strong>my</strong> interpretation of Stoicism.\nHollywood has a somewhat shallow version of a stoic person, typically in the\nform of an action blockbuster hero that doesn’t show emotion, there is so much more.</p>\n<p>Also, do not confuse Stoicism with emotional repression, Stoicism is about\nemotional management or emotional intelligence but never about repression, in fact,\nemotional repression goes against the Stoic teachings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"quotes\" style=\"position:relative;\">Quotes<a href=\"#quotes\" aria-label=\"quotes permalink\" class=\"header-anchor after\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Let’s go over 3 quotes from each of the most important figures of Stoicism:\nSeneca, Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius.</p>\n<p>I encourage you to come back often to them and reflect on them,\nthey are mystical synthesis of knowledge that the Stoic consider\nvaluable and I entirely agree.</p>\n<h3 id=\"marcus-aurelius\" style=\"position:relative;\">Marcus Aurelius<a href=\"#marcus-aurelius\" aria-label=\"marcus aurelius permalink\" class=\"header-anchor after\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Marcus Aurelius Antoninus 26 April 121 – 17 March 180)\nwas Roman emperor from 161 to 180 and a Stoic philosopher.\nThe name might ring a bell since it appeared in the movie “Gladiator”.\nHis thoughts were solidified in books among which the famous <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3sy2G9m\">Meditations</a>,\nis encountered.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If thou art pained by any external thing, it is not this that disturbs thee,\nbut thy own judgment about it. And it is in thy power to wipe out this judgment now.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Marcus Aurelius</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Take away your opinion, and there is taken away the complaint,\n[…] Take away the complaint, […] and the hurt is gone</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Marcus Aurelius</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What if someone despises me? Let me see to it.\nBut I will see to it that I won’t be found doing or saying anything contemptible.\nWhat if someone hates me? Let me see to that. But I will see to it that I’m kind\nand good-natured to all, and prepared to show even the hater where they went wrong.\nNot in a critical way, or to show off my patience, but genuinely and usefully.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Marcus Aurelius</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"epictetus\" style=\"position:relative;\">Epictetus<a href=\"#epictetus\" aria-label=\"epictetus permalink\" class=\"header-anchor after\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Epictetus (c. 55 – c. 135 AD), born a slave, was a Greek Stoic philosopher.\nThe name given by his parents, if one was given, is not known.\nThe word epiktetos in Greek simply means “acquired”.\nYou can read more about his teachings in <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3xbWPKv\">Discourses and Selected Writings</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In a word, neither death, nor exile, nor pain,\nnor anything of this kind is the real cause of our doing\nor not doing any action, but our inward opinions and principles.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Epictetus</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is difficulties that show what men are.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Epictetus</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For it is not death or pain that is to be feared, but the fear of pain or death.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Epictetus</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"seneca\" style=\"position:relative;\">Seneca<a href=\"#seneca\" aria-label=\"seneca permalink\" class=\"header-anchor after\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Lucius Annaeus Seneca the Younger, 4 BC – AD 65, usually known as Seneca,\nwas a Roman Stoic philosopher, statesman, dramatist, and in one work, satirist\nfrom the Silver Age of Latin literature.\nI highly recommend <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3enJvd9\">Letters from a Stoic</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>True happiness is to enjoy the present, without anxious dependence upon\nthe future, not to amuse ourselves with either hopes or fears but to rest satisfied\nwith what we have, which is sufficient, for he that is so, wants nothing.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Seneca</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Throw me to the wolves and I will return leading the pack.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Seneca</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We suffer more often in imagination than in reality.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Seneca</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"closing\" style=\"position:relative;\">Closing<a href=\"#closing\" aria-label=\"closing permalink\" class=\"header-anchor after\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I have tried many different things to improve my self\nand be more resilient and resistant to whatever life throws at me.\nStoicism, meditations and physical exercise are the best tools\nI currently have available, I hope this little post serves as a\nreference point to developers and people going through these same problems in life.</p>\n<br/>","fields":{"slug":"/stoic-developer/","readingTime":{"text":"8 min read"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Stoic Developer","date":"April 22, 2021","description":"Developers are high performance professional thinkers and thus we are particularly susceptible to problems of the mind.
